<br>
Stack here is implemented as per the method taught in our DSA Theortical Subject
<br>
For more detail that how this stack is implemented go through the pdf shared in the Stacks folder.
<br>
Some important detail about this folder is given below :-
<br>
1. Stack here is implemented Array using OOPS .
<br>
2. To indicate NULL in Stack , we used either INT_MIN or -1 which indicate the bottom of the stack.
<br>INT_MIN is used when we want to access the value of top element under underflow condition<br>
Also -1 is used to check underflow conditions in several functions.
<br>
3. The starting index of array is considered as the bottom side of the stack .
<br>
4. Insertion and deletion functions takes place from end side of the array .
<br>
5. Please run the program for stacks in mainProgram.cpp , implement the functions of the stack as specified in the FunctionsOfStack.cpp
