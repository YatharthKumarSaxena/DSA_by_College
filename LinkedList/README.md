# Hi EveryOne , I am the readme file of this Linked List folder to assist you.
<br>
This folder consist of four folders in which you see that each folder implement different typle of linked list
<br>
Each Folder consist of three cpp files and one executable file (ignore executable file)
<br>
Detail of each folder is given below :- 
<br>
For every Linked List implementation at your local machine, mainProgram.cpp file and it's respective function file is required in the same folder.
<br>
1. One file is the main file in which you implement your code ,<br> In this file please do not edit the code above 
"Don't edit above code" comment otherwise you cannot enjoy functions, you can change code below this comment <br>
so that you can implement functions of given linked list. Note:- All the code written below is sample code <br>
written for your understanding.
<br>
2 . Second file consist of Functions of the given linked list , you can explore this file that how these functions work<br> but please do not try to edit any code until if you found an error in code as all functions are <br>
checked by taken different inputs howewer there might be chances that for few special cases <br>
code does not work properly , in that case you can edit the code on my git profile too <br>
Your contribution in this case will be valuable for me
<br>
3. Third file is the Readme file of that folder just like me which tells some deep knowledge about <br>
it's current folder
