# DSA Implementation Repository

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations based on the syllabus taught in college. Although DSA in the 3rd semester is primarily a theoretical subject, this repository represents a personal initiative to practically implement each concept.

The implementations are written in **C++**, derived directly from the **pseudocode** provided in the college lecture slides and presentations. The main objective of this repository is to demonstrate how theoretical pseudocode can be translated into working C++ programs.

While some of these implementations may not be highly optimized, they reflect a clear understanding of how to interpret and convert algorithmic logic into functional code. This process has been both an enjoyable and educational experience.

In this repository:
- Each program is implemented based on pseudocode shared during lectures.
- The pseudocode references will also be provided for better clarity and understanding.
- Data Structures such as **Hash Maps**, **Priority Queues**, and many more have been implemented.

This repository marks the beginning of sharing academic learning experiences and personal implementations on GitHub — serving as both a learning record and a demonstration of applied understanding of DSA fundamentals.
