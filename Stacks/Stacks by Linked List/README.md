# Hi EveryOne , I am the readme file of this folder to assist you.
<br>
This folder consist of three main files one is main file in which you can enjoy Stack programs other one is of function which consist of functions of Stack and an additional file which consist information about this folder is there which you are reading currently, if you found any problem in this folder please feel free to commit changes
<br>
Stack here is implemented as per the method taught in our DSA Theortical Subject
<br>
For more detail that how this stack is implemented go through the pdf shared in the Stacks folder.
<br>
Some important detail about this folder is given below :-
<br>
1. Stack here is implemented by One Way Linked List / Singly Linked List which is made in Linked List folder.
<br>
2. To indicate NULL in Stack , we used INT_MIN which indicate the bottom of the stack
<br>
3. The starting index of array is considered as the top side of the stack where push and pop functions are performed
<br>
So these functions are similar to insertAtHead and deleteAtHead functions of Singly Linked List
<br>
4. Please run the program for singly linked list in mainProgram.cpp , implement the functions of the singly linked list as specified in the FunctionsOfLL.cpp
