# DSA by College (C++ Implementations)

This repository contains **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations based on the **college syllabus (mostly 3rd semester)**.  
All implementations are done in **C++** and are generally based on the **pseudocode / slides** taught in class.

## Repository Structure (Folder-wise)

**Total main folders:** 6

### 1. Algorithm
Contains basic **algorithm implementations**, mainly **sorting**:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort  
Also includes: `5- Sorting Algorithms.pdf`

### 2. HashMaps
Contains **Hashing / Hash Map** implementations:
- Separate Chaining (Open Hashing)
- Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)  
Also includes: `6- Hashing.pdf`

### 3. LinkedList
Contains all major **Linked List** variants:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Circular Doubly Linked List  
Also includes: `7- Linked Lists.pdf`

### 4. Stacks
Contains **Stack** implementations & applications:
- Stack using Array
- Stack using Linked List
- Recursion
- Tower of Hanoi
- Polish Notation
- Quick Sort Algorithm (related topic / implementation)  
Also includes: `8- Stacks.pdf`

### 5. Queue
Contains **Queue** implementations & types:
- Regular Queue
- Deque
- Priority Queue  
Also includes: `9- Queue.pdf`

### 6. Trees
Contains **Tree** related implementations:
- Binary Tree
- Heaps  
Also includes: `10- Tree.pdf`

## Notes
- Code may not be fully optimized; focus is on **learning & understanding**.
- Many folders include PDFs/slides for reference along with implementations.
