## 🛠️ Key Features

### ✨ MinHeap Class
The `MinHeap` class provides the following functionality:
- **Dynamic Capacity Management:** Allows the heap to grow dynamically up to a predefined capacity.
- **Efficient Insertions:** Ensures elements are inserted while maintaining the heap property.
- **Minimum Element Retrieval:** Retrieves the smallest element without disrupting the heap structure.
- **Level-Order Display:** Visualizes the heap for easier debugging and understanding.

### 📋 Function Definitions
- **`void insert(int item):** Inserts an item into the MinHeap.
- **`int removeMinEle():** Removes and returns the smallest element in the MinHeap.
- **`int getMin():** Retrieves the smallest element without removing it.
- **`int size():** Returns the current size of the heap.
- **`void displayMinHeapByLevelOrderTravesal():** Displays the heap in a level-wise order.

## 🎯 Final Takeaway
This project demonstrates a fully functional implementation of a MinHeap data structure in C++. The `MinHeap` class ensures efficient management of elements with operations adhering to the properties of a binary heap. Whether you are studying data structures or implementing algorithms, this project serves as an excellent resource for understanding heaps.
