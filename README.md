# Hi EveryOne , I am the readme file of this Repo to assist you
<br>
This repo is of DSA implementation taught by College. Howewer DSA in my 3rd Sem is a theortical subject but i took the challenge of implementing Data Structures as per College Academics . 
<br>
I am implementing DSA with the help of PSEUDO code that is being given in the ppt from which we learn DSA in our college
<br>
This repo is the indication that how i much understand a pseudocode and implement it in my favourite C++ Language . It is possible that these implementation method will not be so much efficient . But making code on your own from pseudo code is really a big fun for me.
<br>
Pseudo codes will be shared by me from which i have made these programs.
This is the repo where I understood that whatever coding i am doing i should provide it on Github as well.
