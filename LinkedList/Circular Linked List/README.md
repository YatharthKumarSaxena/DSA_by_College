# Hi EveryOne , I am the readme file of this folder to assist you.
<br>
This folder consist of three main files one is main file in which you can enjoy CLL programs other one is of function which consist of functions of CLL and an additional file which consist information about this folder is there , if you found any problem in this folder please feel free to commit changes
<br>
Circular Linked list here is implemented as per the method taught in our DSA Theortical Subject
<br>
Note :- 
1. Here Circular Linked list is implemented by "Header Linked List" where START Pointer always points to the first element of the INFO Array and LINK Array . This Node is linked always to the first node of the linked list.
<br>
2. This means that first node start at index 1 as index 0 is reserved for header node so that last node of the linked list always points to the header node whose index or address is stored in START Variable whose value always remains constant
<br>
For more detail that how these linked list are implemented go through the pdf shared in this folder.
<br>
Some important detail about this folder is given below :-
<br>
1. To check whether header circular linked list is empty , LINK[START] = START is used
<br>
2. Please run the program for circular linked list in mainProgram.cpp , implement the functions of the circular linked list as specified in the FunctionsOfCLL.cpp
